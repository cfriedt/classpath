Java ARchive (JAR) file signing and verification tool.\n\
\n\
FILE is the .JAR file to sign or to verify.\n\
\n\
ALIAS must be a known Alias of a Key Entry in the designated key store.  The \
private key material associated with this Alias is used for signing FILE.  if \
ALIAS is required, but was omitted, "mykey" will be used instead.
Main.1=Please report bugs at http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/bugs.html
Main.0=Signing options
Main.95=Designated alias [{0}] MUST be an Alias of a Key Entry
Main.97=Enter key password for <{0}>: 
Main.99=Key associated with [{0}] MUST be a private key
Main.101=Location of the key store to use.  The default value is a file-based \
scheme whose path is the file named ".keystore" in your home directory.\n\
If URL is malformed, the tool will use URL as a file-name of a key store; \
i.e. as if the protocol was "file:".
Main.102=URL
Main.104=Type of the key store to use.  If omitted, the default value is that \
of the property "keystore.type" in the security properties file.
Main.105=STORE_TYPE
Main.107=Password to unlock the key store.  If omitted, you will be prompted \
to provide a password.
Main.108=PASSWORD
Main.110=Password to unlock the Key Entry associated with ALIAS.  If omitted, \
the tool will use the same password protecting the key store.  If this fails, \
you will be prompted to provide a password.
Main.111=PASSWORD
Main.113=A literal to construct file names for both the .SF and .DSA signature \
files --which will be placed in the META-INF directory of the signed JAR.  \
Permissible characters are in the range [a-zA-Z0-9_-].\n\
If omitted, the first 8 characters of ALIAS will be used.  Characters outside \
that range will be replaced by underscores.
Main.114=NAME
Main.116=Name of the signed JAR file.  If omitted, the signed JAR will be \
named the same as FILE; i.e. the input file will be replaced with its signed \
copy.
Main.117=FILE
Main.118=Verification options
Main.120=Verify an already signed FILE.
Main.122=Use with -verbose to see more detailed information about the \
certificates of ALIAS.
